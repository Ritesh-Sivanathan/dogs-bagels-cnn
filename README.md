# dogs-vs-bagels

my first convolutional neural network ever
started this about 4 hours ago with 0 knowledge on anything ai/ml/nn related (my python knowledge carried)
it's built with tensorflow and keras
i trained it on a total of 10 bagels and 10 dogs ( i know )
my computer already sucks and i don't have enough storage or computing power or will to do anything more

this is just the first out of many projects i'll do like this. i just wanted to prove to myself that qdd actually works

also i didn't use any tutorials or guides or anything i just used a lot of documentation and lots (and lots and lots) of stackoverflow for the errors

to run on ur own machine i think it's just tensorflow you need to install:
pip install tensorflow

okay thanks for reading
