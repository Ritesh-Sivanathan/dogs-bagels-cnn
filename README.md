# Dogs versus Bagels Convolutional Neural Network


## About
#### i believe this is a convolutional neural network. to be honest, i thought it would be cool to try and build something that can tell dogs apart from bagels since some are pretty similar in colour. I don't really know anything about ai/ml/nns yet. i built this with 0 knowledge of tensorflow or anything mentioned before, took about 4 hours. 

## How I built this
#### just using some tensorflow documentation and lots (and lots and lots) of stackoverflow for the countless meaningless errors I got

## Specifics
#### - IT is trained on a whopping 20 images of bagels and dogs, hand selected by me. i'll probably build something similar with more closer looking pictures next, like a curled up dog vs a bagel (much more difficult to tell apart). The latest model I trained had an accuracy of 91%. it works well in terms of how I built it and it's simplicity
- to try just clone the repo, make sure you have tensorflow (2.15) installed, run model.py then classifier.py. upload an image of either a dog or a bagel with a white background (not sure how it works on non-white backgrounds, i've yet to try that) into the models directory. then run classifier.py and it hopefully should work. i tried it a few times
