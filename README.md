# dogs-vs-bagels

❗❗❗❗ -> this is not the classic curled up dog vs bagel. it is pretty easy to distinguish between the dogs and the bagels provided. I made this to learn a bit about tensorflow, neural networks and whatnot. i will probably do something more difficult like that next ❗❗❗❗

my first convolutional neural network ever
took 4 hours. started with 0 knowledge on anything ai/ml/nn related (my python knowledge carried)
it's built with tensorflow and keras
i trained it on a total of 10 bagels and 10 dogs ( i know )
my computer already sucks and i don't have enough storage or computing power or will to do anything more

this is just the first out of many projects i'll do like this. i just wanted to prove to myself that qdd actually works

also i didn't use any tutorials or guides or anything i just used a lot of documentation and lots (and lots and lots) of stackoverflow for the errors

to run on ur own machine:
1. pip install tensorflow
2. run main.py
3. run classifier.py
4. should work pls tell me if it's broken so i can fix it


okay thanks for reading
